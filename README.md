# AstroLab

AstroLab is an Open Source Astrodynamics Matlab Toolkit for all of us to enjoy. 

## Installation

Installing AstroLab is very simple, just copy it somewhere in your Matlab path and start crunching orbits.

## Dependencies

Currently AstroLab requires some Matlab toolboxes (i.e. the Aerospace toolbox). The aim is to AstroLab a standalone package and even make it compatible with Octave!

##Â Usage

Check the documentation inside the functions.
